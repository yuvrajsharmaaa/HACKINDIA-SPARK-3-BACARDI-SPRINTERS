# HACKINDIA-SPARK-3-BACARDI-SPRINTERS
Imagine having a tool that can help you with common household tasks like identifying where the AC or gas pipelines run behind your walls, guiding you on where to drill for plumbing, or even helping you find the perfect spot to hang a painting. Our project is an augmented reality (AR) app that does exactly that.
